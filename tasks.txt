new tasks:
The code is finished and we have got the parameters after running on smaller dataset.
Now @jagath run the code on larger dataset given folder and save those parameters
@arjun calculate the score on the basis of currently computed parameters replace them when jagath is done with training
@adithya cooperate with @arjun with what you want to display on website
@atharv did you start working on report, also we have to prepare a ppt so look into that
